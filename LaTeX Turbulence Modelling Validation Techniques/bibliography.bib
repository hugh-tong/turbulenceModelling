abstract = {An experimental study of low-level turbulence natural convection in an air filled vertical square cavity was conducted. The cavity was 0.75 m high×0.75 m wide×1.5 m deep giving 2D flow. The hot and cold walls of the cavity were isothermal at 50 and 10 °C respectively giving a Rayleigh number of 1.58×109. The local velocity and temperature were simultaneously measured at different locations in the cavity and both mean and fluctuation quantities are presented, i.e. ū, u′rms, v̄, v′rms, T, T′rms, u′v′, u′T′ and v′T′. The local and average Nusselt numbers, the wall shear stress as well as the turbulent kinetic energy and the dissipation rate of the temperature variance are also presented. The experiments were conducted with very high accuracy and as such the results can form experimental benchmark data and will be useful for validation of computational fluid dynamics codes.},

abstract = {Turbulent mixed convection associated with upward and downward flows in heated vertical tubes is investigated using the direct numerical simulation technique. With increasing heat flux, the skin friction first decreases and then increases in upward heated flow, while it changes little in downward heated flow. The heat transfer coefficient exhibits a similar trend in upward heated flow, but it monotonically increases in downward heated flow. The log laws of the mean-velocity and temperature profiles are valid for downward heated flow but not for upward heated flow. Finally, the influence of buoyancy on turbulent transport of momentum and heat is elucidated by the ‘external' and ‘structural' effects.},

abstract = {Experimental limitations for certain nuclear reactor safety applications have pushed forward the demand for high fidelity DNS reference solutions for complex geometric configurations such as a T-junction or a spherical pebble bed. The application of traditional high-order DNS codes is limited to simple flow domains such as a periodic box or channel. As a possibility to create reference DNS solutions for more complex geometries, we have assessed the (quasi-)DNS capabilities of the OpenFOAM finite volume CFD solver for both structured hexahedral meshes and arbitrary polyhedral meshes. The feasibility of (quasi-)DNS analyses on polyhedral grids is of main interest, since this may offer the possibility to significantly expand the availability of (quasi-)DNS-quality data on arbitrarily complex geometries. In order to have a basis for the considered assessment, the mutual differences between generally recognized reference DNS data bases for turbulent channel and pipe flows are determined first. Subsequently, the differences between these reference DNS solutions and the present OpenFOAM (quasi-)DNS solutions are quantified for the considered mesh types. We use an existing finite volume CFD method and well known turbulent channel and pipe flow DNS reference cases for the assessments in this paper. New in this paper are the application of this CFD method to (quasi-)DNS analyses using arbitrary polyhedral meshes, and the quantification of respectively the mutual differences between generally recognized reference DNS data bases and the differences between the obtained OpenFOAM (quasi-)DNS data and these reference DNS data bases. Based on the presented assessment, it is observed that the differences between the OpenFOAM solutions and the considered reference DNS solutions are practically the same as the mutual differences between these reference DNS solutions when structured hexahedral meshes are used. Furthermore, it is observed that the differences as obtained by OpenFOAM on extruded polyhedral meshes are practically the same as those obtained for the structured hexahedral meshes. In contrast, the full polyhedral mesh shows somewhat larger differences near the peaks in the rms velocity profiles, whereas the differences in the bulk flow are again practically the same as those for the hexahedral grids.},

Utilising coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method-Neutronics (CFD-DEM-Neu.), the packing structure of the spherical solid phase and characteristic fluid flow structures are investigated. The geometry implemented is the pebble recirculation experiment (PREX) conducted at University of California, Berkeley (UCB), designed to simulate a pebble-bed, fluoride high temperature reactor's (PB-FHR) core. Numerical coupling implemented accounts for pebble-pebble, pebble-wall, and pebble-fluid exchanges of momentum, while energy is applied to pebbles following a neutronic analysis and transferred between the present phases. Results show the methodology effectively describes the experimental pressure drop and expected packing structures of a randomly formed bed of mono-sized spheres.

The simulation results demonstrate good quantitative agreement with experimental measurements, and show the scaling relations of mean temperature and velocity in the continuous flame, intermittent and plume regions. The numerical simulations are shown to be strictly conservative in energy. Predicted flame heights and entrainment rates also compare well with experimental correlations. The good agreements in all aspects examined show that the current CFD model performs well for small-scale fire plumes. Turbulent fluctuation intensities and PDF of mixture fraction are presented to gain more insights into the structure of fire plumes.},

abstract = {LES for industrial applications with complex geometries is mostly characterised by: a) a finite volume CFD method using a non-staggered arrangement of the flow variables and second order accurate spatial and temporal discretisation schemes, b) an implicit top-hat filter, where the filter length is equal to the local computational cell size, and c) eddy-viscosity type LES models. LES based on these three main characteristics is indicated as industrial LES in this paper. It becomes increasingly clear that the numerical dissipation in CFD codes typically used in industrial applications with complex geometries may inhibit the predictive capabilities of explicit LES. Therefore, there is a need to quantify the numerical dissipation rate in such CFD codes. In this paper, we quantify the numerical dissipation rate in physical space based on an analysis of the transport equation for the mean turbulent kinetic energy. Using this method, we quantify the numerical dissipation rate in a quasi-Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and in under-resolved DNS of, as a basic demonstration case, fully-developed turbulent channel flow. With quasi-DNS, we indicate a DNS performed using a second order accurate finite volume method typically used in industrial applications. Furthermore, we determine and explain the trends in the performance of industrial LES for fully-developed turbulent channel flow for four different Reynolds numbers for three different LES mesh resolutions. The presented explanation of the mechanisms behind the observed trends is based on an analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy budgets. The presented quantitative analyses demonstrate that the numerical errors in the industrial LES computations of the considered turbulent channel flows result in a net numerical dissipation rate which is larger than the subgrid-scale dissipation rate. No new computational methods are presented in this paper. Instead, the main new elements in this paper are our detailed quantification method for the numerical dissipation rate, the application of this method to a quasi-DNS and under-resolved DNS of fully-developed turbulent channel flow, and the explanation of the effects of the numerical dissipation on the observed trends in the performance of industrial LES for fully-developed turbulent channel flows.},

abstract = {A turbulent natural convection flow (Ra=1.58×109) in a confined cavity with two differentially heated side walls was numerically investigated by means of large eddy simulation (LES). The mean flow in the cavity is characterized by stable thermal stratification and a relatively low turbulence level. The LES results for the mean flow quantities show good agreement with the experiment. This is particularly the case when the dynamic model is used. Nevertheless, there are some discrepancies in the prediction of turbulence statistics, particularly in the outer region of the near-wall flow where the boundary layer interacts with the recirculating core region. In the viscous/conductive sublayer of the boundary layer close to the heated/cooled vertical walls, the flow tends to form streak-like structures, which do not however emerge in the near-wall flow along the horizontal top and bottom walls. To resolve the flow structure near the vertical walls, sufficient grid resolution is required.},

abstract = {CFD calculations of turbulent flow near smooth walls generally employ one of two broad strategies to resolve the very influential, complex, but thin near-wall viscosity-affected sub-layer. One approach uses a fine numerical mesh and a turbulence model incorporating viscous influences; the other employs “wall functions”—formulae that attempt to account for the overall resistance of the sublayer to momentum and heat transport. The latter requires only a fraction of the computational effort of the former and is thus strongly favoured for industrial calculations. However, the wall-function performance is often poor, partly because of inappropriate implementations and partly because the schemes themselves have inherent limitations.The present paper reviews the evolution of wall-function strategies. Attention is then given to two new schemes developed by the authors, one based on an analytical treatment and the other on a numerical resolution of the near-wall sub-layer. Several applications are shown of mixed and forced convection.},

A high-order split-centered scheme is used to discretize the convective fluxes of the Navier–Stokes equations, and is found to be highly effective to overcome the dissipative character of the standard shock-capturing WENO scheme. The consistency and the accuracy of the simulations are evaluated using direct numerical simulations taken from the literature. It is demonstrated that all SGS models require a comparable minimum grid refinement in order to capture accurately the near-wall turbulence. Overall, the models exhibit correct behavior when predicting the dynamic properties, but show different performances for the temperature distribution in the near-wall region even for cases with satisfactory energy resolution of more than 80{\%}. For a well-resolved LES, the SGS dissipation due to the fluctuating velocity gradients is found to dominate the total SGS dissipation.},

The distributions of temperature and pressure of the fluoride salt, as well as the reflector temperature profile, are obtained using the porous model. The detailed local flow and heat transfer are investigated by the realistic modeling method for the locations which may have the maximum coolant temperature based on the results of the porous model. The profiles of temperature, velocity, pressure and Nusselt number (Nu) of the coolant on the surface of the pebble are also obtained and analyzed. Numerical results showed that the flow field between the fuel pebbles is complex including secondary flow and back-flow phenomenon, which are hard to measure by experiments.

Mean values of the temperature near the wall show that the conventional law of the wall is valid in this case. However, the region where 〈v+〉=r+, is much smaller than that of forced convection. With respect to turbulence production, the near-wall behavior of turbulent shear stress and normal stresses are investigated and compared with the experimental results. The existence of a negative shear stress region close to the wall in the simulations is confirmed and its influence on stream-wise normal stress is shown. The integral form of the momentum equation suggests that the buoyancy balances the combination of the turbulent stresses and the viscous term.

The compressible three-dimensional Favre-filtered mass, momentum and energy conservation equations have been closed using the Smagorinsky, dynamic, approximate localised dynamic and Vreman models. A two-stage predictor–corrector numerical methodology for low-Mach-number compressible flows was adopted to strongly couple the density with the Navier–Stokes equations. Based on the comparison with experimental data, it has been shown that the Smagorinsky model predicts inaccurate near-wall flow dynamics and delayed transitional behaviour while both dynamic procedures to compute the Smagorinsky model coefficient result in over prediction of wall temperatures, suggesting an under estimation of subgrid-scale dissipation. The time extrapolation procedure utilised in the approximate localised dynamic model has been shown to produce better adaptation towards the local flow behaviour when compared with the standard dynamic model. At the same time, time-averaged wall temperature and velocity field profiles have been well captured by the Vreman model, demonstrating its superiority when compared to the rest of the models.},

Three rotation numbers Ro=0.18, 0.35 and 0.67 are investigated. The rib height to channel hydraulic diameter (e/Dh) is 0.1, the rib pitch to rib height (P/e) is 10 and the calculations have been carried out for a bulk Reynolds number of 20,000. The capability of the detached eddy simulation (DES) in predicting the turbulent flow field and the heat transfer under the effects of rotation has been evaluated against unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (URANS), large-eddy simulations (LES), and experimental data. It is shown that DES by capturing a large portion of the turbulent energy in the resolved scales is much more capable than URANS in transcending the underlying shortcomings of the RANS model. DES shows much better fidelity in calculating critical components of the turbulent flow field and heat transfer than URANS.},

@article{Shur2008,
abstract = {A CFD strategy is proposed that combines delayed detached-eddy simulation (DDES) with an improved RANS-LES hybrid model aimed at wall modelling in LES (WMLES). The system ensures a different response depending on whether the simulation does or does not have inflow turbulent content. In the first case, it reduces to WMLES: most of the turbulence is resolved except near the wall. Empirical improvements to this model relative to the pure DES equations provide a great increase of the resolved turbulence activity near the wall and adjust the resolved logarithmic layer to the modelled one, thus resolving the issue of “log layer mismatch” which is common in DES and other WMLES methods. An essential new element here is a definition of the subgrid length-scale which depends not only on the grid spacings, but also on the wall distance. In the case without inflow turbulent content, the proposed model performs as DDES, i.e., it gives a pure RANS solution for attached flows and a DES-like solution for massively separated flows. The coordination of the two branches is carried out by a blending function. The promise of the model is supported by its satisfactory performance in all the three modes it was designed for, namely, in pure WMLES applications (channel flow in a wide Reynolds-number range and flow over a hydrofoil with trailing-edge separation), in a natural DDES application (an airfoil in deep stall), and in a flow where both branches of the model are active in different flow regions (a backward-facing-step flow).},

Isoflux wall boundary conditions with low and high heating are imposed. The compressible filtered Navier–Stokes equations are solved using a second order accurate finite volume method. Low Mach number preconditioning is used to enable the compressible code to work efficiently at low Mach numbers. A dynamic subgrid-scale stress model accounts for the subgrid-scale turbulence. Comparisons were made with available experimental data. The results showed that the strong heating and buoyant force caused distortions of the flow structure resulting in reduction of turbulent intensities, shear stress, and turbulent heat flux, particularly near the wall.},

abstract = {The development of the Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor (FHR) is ongoing. The molten salt coolant provides several inherent safety characteristics that traditional water-cooled nuclear reactors lack. The first test reactor to be built in China is a pebble-bed type. Research efforts are currently focused on determining the heat transfer characteristics of such a reactor. In the past, the pebble-bed geometry has been studied for the development of the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR). The previous work has indicated that the profile of the Nusselt number depends on both the lattice structure and pebble contact. In this work, a new series of simulations is sought to characterize heat transfer in an FHR pebble-bed. Due to the physical properties of molten salt and the FHR design, the Reynolds number is roughly three orders of magnitude lower than the HTGR while the Prandtl number is roughly an order of magnitude higher. Thus, the flow in an FHR lattice is expected to be unlike the HTGR counterpart. Three different lattices (Simple Cubic (SC), Body Centered Cubic (BCC), and Face Centered Cubic (FCC)) are considered. The study found that the different lattice geometries have a significant impact on the heat transfer characteristics. The SC lattice has a simplified flow that minimizes pressure-drop and Nusselt number. The BCC and FCC lattice have a complicated flow structure resulting in an order of magnitude higher pressure-drop and almost double the Nusselt number. It was concluded that heat transfer characteristics in a random pebble-bed would be highly sensitive to the mixing, and thus turbulent heat transfer, along the flow path. It was also found that while an interstitial gap allows heat transfer characteristics to be replicated, the pressure loss is significantly lower, while the computational costs increase. Correlations available in the literature (developed primarily for HTGRs) have a mixed performance in prediction of the Nusselt number. The result suggests that new experimental efforts are necessary to develop correlations that pertain to FHR conditions.},

The proposed pebble-bed FHR designs use a high Prandtl number molten salt coolant, 2LiF–BeF2, with spherical fuel elements. In order to determine convective heat transfer coefficients, packed-bed correlations available in the literature are used. However, past correlations were developed for either gas or water as the coolant, which have a low Prandtl number (NPr≈1). This study assesses the applicability of such correlations using numerical simulations. A range of Reynolds numbers (102⩽NRe≤2.25{\textperiodcentered}103) is evaluated that encompass the proposed FHR designs (NPr≈16). The study finds that most conventional correlations miss the qualitative and quantitative trend predicted by both k$\epsilon$ and LES turbulence models. The Meng correlation (Meng et al., 2012) was found to provide a good agreement with numerical results. Both turbulence models have good agreement up to NRe{\textless}103 for surface-averaged parameters.

abstract = {Turbulence has been the victim of many colorful descriptions over the years, from Lamb's (1916) scholarly “chief outstanding difficulty of our subject” to Bradshaw's (1994) inspired “invention of the Devil on the seventh day of creation.” This apparent frustration results largely from the mixture of chaos and order and the wide range of length and time scales that turbulent flows possess . The three key elements of CFD are algorithm development, grid generation and turbulence modelling. Turbulence is inherently three-dimensional and time dependent, and an enormous amount of information is thus required to completely describe a Introduction Turbulent Flow. This is beyond the capability of the existing computers for virtually all practical flows. Thus, some kind of approximate and statistical method, called a turbulence model, is needed. 
Complexity of different turbulence models may vary strongly depends on the details one wants to observe and investigate by carrying out such numerical simulations. N-S equation is inherently nonlinear, time-dependent, three-dimensional PDE. Turbulence could be thought of as instability of laminar flow that occurs at high Reynolds numbers. Such instabilities origin form interactions between non-linear inertial terms and viscous terms in N-S equation. These interactions are rotational, fully time-dependent and fully three-dimensional. Rotational and three-dimensional interactions are mutually connected via vortex stretching. Vortex stretching is not possible in two dimensional space. That is also why no satisfactory two-dimensional approximations for turbulent phenomena are available. Furthermore turbulence is thought of as random process in time. Therefore no deterministic approach is possible. Certain properties could be learned about turbulence using statistical methods. These introduce certain correlation functions among flow variables. However it is impossible to determine these correlations in advance .},
